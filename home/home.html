            Hi there, I'm Steve, glad you've found me!
        </p>
        <p>I am a Student Web Developer specializing in MEAN Stack web development, and I love making websites work well and look good. While the complicated ones give me "WOW", the simplistic ones give me "CALM" and I have to admit I love them both.
